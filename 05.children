And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:
And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son  in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
