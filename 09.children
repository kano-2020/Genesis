I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.
and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
