And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
